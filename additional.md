### IPR and Well Performance curve

* Inflow Performance Relationship \(IPR\) of a well is the relation between the production rate and flowing **bottom hole pressure** \(BHP\). 
* Well Performance Curve is the relation between the production rate and flowing **tubing head pressure** \(THP\).

Unlike IPR, Well Performance Curve considers both [PI](additional.md#pi-productivity-index) and Vertical lift.

IPR widely used for [nodal analysis](additional.md#nodal-analysis) and Well Performance Curve may have more practical value, as THP is usually more widely available than BHP.

NETool allows to generate both IPR and Well Performance Curve. To generated them in Well Target & IPR should be chosen "Generate IPR". [See Exercise on Well target, IPR and Well Performance Curve.](exercises.md#well-target-ipr-and-well-performance-curve)

\*Note: if BHP at 0 MD, NETool will generate plot BHP vs Rates which called IPR but in fact is Well Performance Curve
